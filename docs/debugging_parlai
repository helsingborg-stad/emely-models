ideas for teacher

ParlAIDialogTeacher override:
- next_example: if first example and text == '' actually in fixeddialogteacher

FixedDialogTeacher:
- next_example: if first example and text == ''

DialogData
- context!!!
- what subclasses this?
- look at tasks with context
- use display_model on a task with context and debug
- blended skill talk!!! It seems to generate a conversation history before the model starts predicting so that should work!!!!!!

Blendedskilltalk:
- there's a lot of information in the data, always a choice between convai, ed, ww and free text(no idea). Sometimes a guided suggestion for what to choose. BUT, all I'm interested in is how it's fed to the model on the first pass, right? Debug away with display model :D
- How is it converted to a parlai Message?


OKAY HERE WE GO:
SO the way previous lines are separated is by a __literal__ '\\n', as opposed to a '\n'. In text(non literal) this of course appears as a '\n' hence the fucking confusion...
