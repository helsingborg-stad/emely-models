where is the history saved?
- transformer. During observe()
- self.observation????
- type: parlai.core.torch_agent.History

currently @ eval_Step

during act():
- TorchAgent.batch_act(self.observation: Message)
- TorchGeneratorAgent.eval_step(batch: torch_agent.Batch) - This does the model pass and beam search
- TorchGeneratorAgent._generate(
- self_observe() - Used to add to the history


As I see it I only need to use observe and act. Observe is a little tricky though as we won't be able to store any information. I want to act on just one observation. 
- Can I modify observe?


- HOw do I load a transformer model outside a world????



HISTORY:
- At model inference: create a History object and set it to be the models self.history. Then act. Boom
- Maybe subclass the TransformerGeneratorAgent and implement a function "amnesia" or something that creates the temporary history object


AIGHT so after self.self_observe(), the model reply is added to the models history of the conversation AND THEN history.get_history_str() returns 'hey\nhi , how are you today ? i just got back from a long day of work , how about you ?'
- the \n seems to be a real line break. Confusing...

HISTORY.get_history_vec
