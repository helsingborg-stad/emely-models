text:User: And I actually called the person who was off sick just to ask them for some advice about how they approached all of their tasks. When I went back to work, the following morning, I sat down, and I put a plan of action in place. So I assessed my own tasks, I then put the other person's tasks next to them, and I prioritize what I would need to do to get everything done. So I had a plan of action of how I was going to complete the tasks, and then work tirelessly to complete their tasks on time. And also to get mine done to now to achieve that goal. I had to stay behind late a couple of nights after work for a couple of hours. But I was more than happy to do that. I got a lot out of that situation, because I learned some skills that I hadn't previously managed to undertake. So I was diversifying my skill range, I was improving my ability to work under pressure as well. So it was a win win situation for the organization, because my manager, got somebody to complete the tasks on time. And I learned something new, which was, as I say, a win win situation.	labels:Excellent. Thank you. So how would you deal with conflict with a co worker?episode_done:True
text:I'm excited about this interview.	labels:Okay, now that you've explained, why do you want to join us? Can you give me top three reasons? Why should we hire you?
text:First, I'd like to say that I'm a good team player. While working on a final year project, one of our project team members fell ill. So I took over his part of the project work so that our team does not lose momentum. I also consider myself to be very active and energetic worker, I enthusiastically participate in my volunteer work with the NGO, along with a very demanding study schedule. Finally, I think I'm used to hard work and stretching whenever situations demanded.	labels:What will you do if you're not selected today?	episode_done:True
text:I'm a little nervous but we can start the interview now.	labels:So moving on to your fourth question, I want to show you an object and you're going to describe to me what that object is and how I use it. Because let's pretend I've never seen this object before. What is this? And how would you explain how to use it to me though,
text:that is, it's called a mobile phone, or a phone. And it is essentially a device that allows people to communicate. And so that looked like a phone that had a touchscreen, so you would switch it on and open it up. It's also a device that allows for many other different activities such as taking photos, and listening to music by using headphones which sort of plug in To your ears, so you can hear through those. And and by connecting to the internet. So you might be able to ask a question of your phone, for example, or search for nearby restaurants. So that would involve opening up the internet function, typing in what your request is.	labels:So thank you for explaining to me how to use this object that I showed you. Why do you think I asked you to do that.
text:And so I imagine it's because communication is like a pivotal skill in medicine. And as doctors, we would have to communicate with not only other doctors and patients, but of course, like members of the multidisciplinary team, so nurses, paramedics, and I guess families, as well as for certain doctors sort of marketing in public health campaigns. And communication is sort of the essence of making sure that you are providing like good care to your patients. Because if they don't feel comfortable telling you things, and you can't explain things to them, then they don't know what kind of treatment they're on, they might not sort of understand their condition properly, or how to manage it. And you might not be able to communicate what they're sort of telling you to other doctors or nurses that might need that to sort of continue or sort of help manage their care as well.	labels:Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so moving on to your final question. And what I want to ask you is why kings? Why have you chosen this medical school, we have so many in London, so why kings.	episode_done:True
text: 	labels:All right, what is your greatest strength?

text: 	labels:If you are going to work as a medical doctor, it is good if you have experience from working with others. Can you tell me a little if you have such experience?
text:I volunteered as an assistant for doctors without borders when I started medical school.	labels:Where did you volunteer?episode_done:True
text: 	labels:But okay, now, can you tell me about your greatest strength?
text:Sure. I feel my greatest strength is probably my intelligence. I'm a quick learner. It doesn't take me long to pick up on new policies, new ways of doing things. And I actually enjoy it's one of the reasons I chose this profession. Because it's kind of a lifelong learning process.	labels:So you'd be okay with new training programs and everything?	episode_done:True
text:I'm a little nervous but we can start the interview now.	labels:What makes you a good fit?

text:I'm a little nervous but we can start the interview now.	labels:So here your hours may fluctuate between days nights, and we might need you on holidays or send you out to events or schedule them. Would that be a problem? The flexibility at all?
text:I'm already used to that working in retail, you have to kind of be available whenever. So definitely already used to that that's not a problem for me at all. I'm graduating. So school is not an issue anymore. I'm pretty open.	labels:And do you have any questions, comments or anything for me?	episode_done:True
text:I'm excited about this interview.	labels:Okay, if you had an ideal job, what would you be doing every day?

text:Not actually I have not. I was never interested in that stuff.	labels:Ok, but why should I hire someone that does not have any previous experience?	episode_done:True
text:I'm a little nervous but we can start the interview now.	labels:So how do you prioritize the work that needs to be done in it? hardware software issues pop up all the time? Yes. So if the president of the company would phone and say hey, my PC is not working, or the security server went down, which Good, what's a priority? And how would you manage completing both?
text:we first we have to shut down all the connections around the branch, so we don't have chances of invasion or outside from dangerous, then we will prioritize, we checked make server, which is the master computer, check if it's properly connected with the older computers in the network. And then we will check out the computer which had the problem. So we will see, fix the problem. And then we will restart the network again.	labels:You realize that our organization has a huge network, not something one person can do all by itself, our department currently has about 25 technicians on board because not only do we do it on site, but we also manage it by remote guests.

text:There been so many times that I feel good about the work that I do that I've heard that I have helped someone. So it's hard to pinpoint just one, but there is a client that comes to mind. And of course, I won't give too many specific details. But I felt like we kind of gave her a makeover in her life, because she, she came for a divorce, and from an abusive husband. And we got we helped her get a divorce. And unfortunately, she went back to her abusive husband, and continue to be in an awful situation, and financially ruined, and came back for another divorce in we helped her again, and this time, we helped her to get a bankruptcy to clear her credits. We helped her to clear her record. And we helped her to get her driver's license back, which was just a mess of why it had even been taken away in the first place. And helped her get child support from her abusive husband, so that she could support her five children. So I think about her and you know, she always asked for me when she would call, and I'm not sure why except I guess I was just patient with her. And she always had problems getting her documents together. And, you know, I was always being creative and how I can help serve her. And she always had to walk or catch the bus anytime because she had no driver's license. So it was a challenge. But I felt like we you know, we helped her get her life back on track.	labels:That's wonderful. And so in that situation and and other situations such as that, what do you think was the hallmark of success that allowed her to ask for you? And she called and, you know, what, what were your characteristics that you think you displayed to her? Well, I
text:delivered on what I promised. And when she called him and asked her things, sometimes multiple times the same documents that she might misplace or she didn't get or something got spilled on them. So you know, if she needed another copy of something, I got it to her, even after she was no longer our client, and she still needed the document, at the end of her bankruptcy to the certificate to show that she had discharged her debts. She needed it a couple of times since then. And she you know, she knows that she can I will deliver on what I promise. So I think that's why she asked for me.	labels:Okay, excellent. Excellent, good, good. So where do you see yourself saying the next five years?	episode_done:True
text: 	labels:Is there anything else in the UK in terms of culture or anything you'd like to comment on?

I've gone into cafes before and just had a few dirty looks a few kind of comments of older lady, particularly.	labels:So that's, let's let's do that question to a close. So how would you ensure a good work life balance on a midwifery course?
text:I know it doesn't say very difficult to work uni to kiss my husband. But I think the main thing I have to do is prioritize. So you know for three years of my life, my my life is going to be unique. Me and my husband and the children have all sat down and talked about it they totally understand they totally support me.	labels:So that brings this bit of the interview to a close.

text:I'm excited about this interview.	labels:Elizabeth, your first question today is why medicine.
text:I think, for me, I'm really interested in helping people and having like a career where I can actively see like the difference that I make in the world. And so when I was looking into medicine and other healthcare roles, I looked into other roles that support doctors like nursing and parent paramedics. But I think medicine kind of stood out for me in like their inability to diagnose and have that kind of, it's a bit like a detective story where you can work out exactly what is wrong with the patient and come to the conclusion of how best to treat them. And I think I really value the the work that people like paramedics do in in helping in really critical situations. But I think the breadth of medicine was really something that kind of drew me towards that in particular. And yeah,	labels:yeah, great. And as you mentioned, there are many different healthcare staff members, so why not nursing because they have a similar kind of patient facing role. So what made you decide that actually, I want to be a doctor instead+
text:And so I looked into nursing. And I think there's a lot of capacity now actually, in nursing to learn a lot more about for example, diagnosing. And so there's lots of nurses in GP practices that also help with taking consultations on their own and supporting doctors in that way. But I think, although the work is incredibly valuable that nurses do, and I think for me, I wanted something where I had that constant progression, and was able to keep on learning keep on looking into different spheres of medicine and and sort of have again, like I said, that kind of width of knowledge.	labels:Yeah, absolutely. And when it comes to being a doctor, are there any aspects of medicine or becoming a doctor that you're worried about? Or you think might be downsides to the job?	episode_done:True

text:Now I'm looking for a company where I can grow and expand my experience in this industry. That is why I'm so interested in joining a huge agency like yours.	labels:Did you quit your first job? Or did you get fired?	episode_done:True
text:I'm a little nervous but we can start the interview now.	labels:Can you describe a time for me ever that you may have disagreed on a decision that was made for you and staff members at work? And how did you deal with this?
text:Sure, within the field of education, there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time. And sometimes those initiatives get mandated. You have to teach this way this many times a week. And when something like that happens, I think it's important to go back to what you know about your profession or your skill set and be able to provide research that supports why you do what you do. And I think when faced with the difficulty again, it's important to do what the boss says. And it's an important to also advocate for what might be best for the customer or student.	labels:All right, we're gonna Then move on to some cognitive behavioral questions. And basically, these questions are designed. They're not necessarily about your past your experience, they're sort of out of the box questions. And so just do your best at answering them as we go through this. So, if you were an animal, what would you be? And why?	episode_done:True

text:because banking, I can practice my expertise, my what I study in my university, because I study finance. So I think banking sector is would be a place that I can practice my knowledge.	labels:But to practice knowledge, we still have a lot, a lot of industry to joining, but why choose banking, banking, can be financial analyst, IT company, or you can even join audit firm, to be an accountant, you start probably don't even know, but why choose banking?
text:And then, of course, the industry is very stable. So looking for a more stable company instead of microSD. With Greek kind of industry, that's where I choose some banking sector.	labels:What is your long term goal?	episode_done:True
text:I'm excited about this interview.	labels:absolutely. And so you mentioned that you'd like to write down the feelings behind that. So is that something you do often? And why do you think that reflection is an important skill as a doctor?
text:Well, that's an interesting question. So I think that is important for me, because it helps me see why I am procrastinating or why I'm not doing the job that I'm trying to get done. And I think that by looking at sort of the reasons behind that, that allows me to sort of combat them rather than be distracted by the task itself. And I think reflection and sort of improvement is really critical in medicine, because it allows clinicians to constantly be thinking about ways in which they can continue to develop their skills, their communication. And given how fast paced or how stressful a lot of medicine is, you might not get that time while you're in a consultation, it might be something that you have to think about afterwards. And kind of consider how it might work if there was a different patient in the room, or how you might have to sort of change the way that you communicate with somebody if, for example, English wasn't their first language.	labels:Yeah, absolutely. very valid points. So Elizabeth, for your third question, this is going to be a bit of an ethical dilemma, as I'm sure you're aware, we face many of these in medicine every single day. And this one today concerns two patients that are both in need of a lung transplant. The first is a 12 year old girl who has cystic fibrosis, which is a chronic condition that affects your lungs. And the second patient that concerns a 62 year old chronic smoker who has a wife and two children, and he has very damaged lungs from smoking. So who in your opinion should get the organ because there is only one organ available?
text:Well, obviously, that's a really difficult and horrible situation. But it does sort of go to show that there's sort of our decisions being made, where resources have to be put one way and not another. And so I don't have an immediate answer. But if you don't mind, I'm gonna work through what I'm thinking and then hopefully, it will come to a conclusion. So I guess, in terms of the ethical principles behind sort of medicine, and there's autonomy, which is like the patient's right to choose. So it's, it's a really hard situation. And but I think given the the age of the patients, I would probably give it to the younger to the child who was suffering with cystic fibrosis, if other considerations couldn't, and sort of if there were no other treatments available.	labels:Yeah, absolutely. I think, as you mentioned, it's a very difficult scenario. And I don't think there is any right or wrong answer. But as you highlighted, it's so important that we don't discriminate based on, you know, the fact that he is a smoker, and you could argue it's a self inflicted disease, because that's not how we make decisions in medicine at all. We treat people with equal fairness, no matter what. So really nice answer. Thank you. Okay. So moving on to your fourth question, I want to show you an object and you're going to describe to me what that object is and how I use it. Because let's pretend I've never seen this object before. What is this? And how would you explain how to use it to me though,	episode_done:True

text: 	labels:What's your greatest weakness?
text:My greatest weakness would definitely be that I worry too much.

And then come into college, I had that mindset of I'm just gonna, like, do whatever. And then I got involved on campus. I ended up getting Dean's List both semesters of my freshman year, and then both semester sophomore year, and then it continued up until my senior year, I made Dean's list every, almost every semester, a couple semesters, I haven't but close enough.

text:I'm a little nervous but we can start the interview now.	labels:Excellent, excellent. So, um, so what made you decide to transition from journalism to your previous career in social services?
text:I think when I started out in journalism, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do. I was 18 years old. And I knew that I love to write, and I like to ask questions about the world. So that was a way that I could ask questions and learn things and be out in the community and talk to people in on the scene. And then I also learned that journalists are not as objective as we might like to think they are. And so I kind of transitioned into public relations where I could use my voice for cause. And then from there, I got more into social services. I was always specializing in nonprofit communication throughout my undergrad studies at SEIU Carbondale where I studied public relations, it was with an emphasis on nonprofits and minors in government and sociology. So I knew that somewhere I wanted to be in the middle of these things, but I didn't exactly know where so I see my career as a path that I'm, you know, growing and learning and changing and, and kind of taking direction from the world around me. And you know, where it leads me,	labels:Okay, so So what has been say your biggest challenge in your current position, what on a day to day basis is the biggest challenge?

And so I think that we're in a pretty good place right now and actually Coronavirus, kind of helped in slowing down so yeah, in some of the events, the outreach events that we were going to have, unfortunately, were canceled. So it you know, I don't know how much our vendors are gonna like the numbers when all this is said and done, but it has decreased the number of cases.	labels:Yeah, well, maybe you'll get like a fresh start from You know, everything caught up?

text:I'm a little nervous but we can start the interview now.	labels:So I guess for starters, what led you to finding our job posting?
text:Well, I actually spoke with my aunt who did 30 years of freelance makeup artistry, because I've always been intrigued in it. So she told me, the best way to move from more of a retail type place to a freelance type job was to do a department store type positions, where you get more in depth with a specific brand. So that's where I'm really looking to kind of transition from being in a retail store where we sell everything to really narrowing down to throwing myself into one particular brand. And being a little bit more involved with that brand. And to do that, I need to find some type of freelance type job like through Macy's or a department store or something like that.	labels:What brands are you interested in?	episode_done:True
text:I'm excited about this interview.	labels:If you are going to work in the healthcare industry, it is good if you have experience from working with others. Can you tell me a little if you have such experience?
text:I have worked in the healthcare industry for 13 years now, at all of my three previous jobs it's been crucial to collaborate with my colleagues.	labels:Can you tell me a little more about the collaboration you've done?
text:Yes. It's important to communicate information about patients when switching shifts and to synchronize with colleagues in order to be efficient.	labels:And how would you communicate this information on a stressful day?	episode_done:True
text:I'm a little nervous but we can start the interview now.	labels:If you are going to work in the healthcare industry, it is good if you have experience from working with others. Can you tell me a little if you have such experience?
text:When I worked as a healthcare assistant, I worked with patients. I helped them with their basic hygiene activities.	labels:What type of patients are you helping with?episode_done:True
text: 	labels:And when it comes to being a doctor, are there any aspects of medicine or becoming a doctor that you're worried about? Or you think might be downsides to the job?
text:Oh, yeah, I think I think it's an incredibly taxing job, both in terms of the sort of hours that you do, and, and in terms of it being sort of emotionally draining, as well as, like, all of the disadvantages that come with any sort of like, person facing role. And it's some, sometimes incredibly difficult to deal with people that are emotionally distressed. And I think seeing, seeing people who are very unwell will be really quite difficult for me. But I'm hopeful that that's something that I will be able to talk to my colleagues about, and be able to sort of work through and, and continue to have sort of a, I guess, like a sustainable career in that sense.	labels:Thank you for that. So your second question is What in your opinion is your greatest weakness.
text:Um, so I think for me, probably my greatest weakness is that I sometimes procrastinate quite a bit before starting a task. And, and I realized that that is something that sort of holds me back in being able to sort of fulfill my goals. And as well as something that's sort of not isn't very helpful for medicine. And given that there's lots of situations where things are time critical. And so the way that I've started to try and think about that, and having done some reading on sort of procrastination is that it's a lot easier to sort of write down the feelings behind that, and then come to sort of a conclusion that getting a task done, and making sure it's, it's done rather than by perfect is the best way to sort of go about it. And so what I'm trying to do to work on that is to ensure that I write down the critical tasks that I need to get done, and sort of remind myself that like, done is good enough. And it's better than not done at all. Yeah,	labels:absolutely. And so you mentioned that you'd like to write down the feelings behind that. So is that something you do often? And why do you think that reflection is an important skill as a doctor?	episode_done:True

text:Thanks for having me!	labels:Let me ask this final question. Or do you have any questions for us?
text:Well, I mentioned a couple times about being interested in helping grow a market for Rei. I'm just curious as a new employee, or someone starting out on the lower level, how open is upper management hearing the ideas of an employee?	labels:We do try to have monthly meetings where we meet with a variety of employees at random. So these aren't things that are necessarily scheduled, but regularly they're very, they're very semi annual. They're very informal. We do like to hear our employees opinions about our products, especially and about marketing. One thing that we don't necessarily do is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections or you know, the intake and distribution of customer service calls. We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very often. But I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that. Should you be hired for the position and maybe ways that we can do better as well by reaching a larger group of our employees to benefit our company.
text:Okay. And then last question, for me, what from your perspective is the best part about working for Rei.	labels:I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming. And even in my position, and somewhat upper management, those that I work for that are above me, they're very, we're very good to our employees. And I think because of the treatment of our employees, we retain employment. It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs. I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who were more tyrannical in nature, and it's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do in those situations. So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in our particular company is the atmosphere itself. Great.	episode_done:True
text:Thanks for having me!	labels:So where do you see yourself saying the next five years?
text:I want to work for a firm that is a strong team that I can learn from and that is energizing, that is working on cases that are, you know, setting new precedent and, you know, challenging the status quo and finding new ways to help people through the legal system.	labels:Okay. Excellent. Excellent. And what do you know about us that makes you want to work with us?
text:Well, I have an interest in bankruptcy from my experience. And so I'm very excited about that possibility to see both sides of the bankruptcy law and federal courts because I haven't done much with that. And I would like to do litigation, more litigation support than I have been allowed to do. So that the bankruptcy part is very interesting, and the sec. requirements are new to me, and I love to learn things. And I think that there are lots of things that go on, pertaining to sec regulations that people should be more aware of. So I would love to learn about that as well.	labels:Wonderful, wonderful. Um, is there any particular area of the law that you really want to stay away from?	episode_done:True

Or he texted me all that and I'm giving it right back to you. You're my assistant, you're my marketing specialist. So I need to know what you're going to do not me.

And, uh, I like some of the flexibility to work late into the night if I'm really rolling on something. But then I do, like, come into the office and printing. It seems like, there's you know, it's, there's so much printing. So,	labels:yes, I've definitely gotten a lot more creative with my eye, not printing as much as possible. I guess that's a good thing. But oh, my God, that's definitely that I agree with you. That has been one of the biggest changes and hurdles, I guess you could say. So I did look over your resume. And why don't you kind of just give me a summary of of yourself, you know, summarize your resume or your professional background?
text:Yes, so I have mostly worked in social services, through my career in community organizing, and I worked as a director for an adult day center. And so that was wearing all kinds of hats. But I would categorize my previous experience as social services. And then I decided to get into the legal field. And I went back to school for my paralegal degree, and I will complete that in August. And I also started working for the legal aid, Land of Lincoln legal aid, and that really, yeah, it was a mesh of the two passions. I think that helped me make the decision that I wanted to switch my career to the legal field from social services. And I still get the great feeling of helping people and in the, the knowledge of the legal world.	labels:And am I correct? I noticed on your resume that you assist a lot with like, the whole expungement process. And so that's definitely a method of helping.	episode_done:True

text: 	labels:Okay, excellent. Now, I always ask a, kind of a two part question. So and you kind of answered this already, but I'll just ask it. And, you know, like I said, a lot of times are coming to the firm for assistance, during a very traumatic time in their life. And with that being said, sometimes that, you know, stress can be high, how would you handle a situation, if a client came into the office and, you know, right or wrong, you're probably the first person they're going to see their main contact, and say, they're rude to you.
text:That does happen quite frequently, unfortunately, because they are stressed. And they're confused. It's a, you know, there's so much jargon and they don't know what's going to happen. And, you know, remember my tone, especially, and try to ask questions to get information so that I can understand their their question because they a lot of times don't even know where to begin with, you know, asking for help. And then, you know, just say, You're not the only one that's went through this and it will be okay.	labels:Excellent, excellent. And, and kind of part two of that questions, because you will have such an interactive relationship with each individual, you're going to know a lot about their personal life. How would you handle a situation where, you know, a client would say, Nicolette, what should I do now?
text:Gosh, that happens a lot with a rent because people want to know if they have to pay the rent. And all I can say it's very hard. And sometimes I have to say it over and over again, for them to understand that I cannot tell them whether or not they can pay their day should pay their rent. That's a decision that they're going to have to make based on their situation. And so you know it. Sometimes I feel like I'm a broken record whenever I'm in those situations, because it's tempting to say, you know, this, but it can't. So I just have to say it and be firm that that's all I'm going to give you.	labels:Yeah. Excellent. Excellent. So from your resume, I can see you have done very well. And obviously, you've done well.
