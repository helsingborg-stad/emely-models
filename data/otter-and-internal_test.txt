text:Yes, I'm still very interested.	labels:Okay, we'll be in touch by next week.	episode_done:True
text: 	labels:Do you want to ask anything else?
text:And can I also asked, please, what's frustrated you about people who've held this position in the past?	labels:Yeah, that's an excellent question. So as a company, we look for people that have a willingness to learn and a drive to move forward. As Andy mentioned, we're expanding our operations at the moment. And so having that drive and willingness to learn is really important to us. Unfortunately, previous employees in the role have lacked that ambition and drive to move forward. So that's what we're looking for in the ideal candidate for this role.
text:And I know I would say this, but I'm very enthusiastic and ambitious. So I believe that I can bridge that gap for sure. Just one final question. If I am successful, what would you need me to concentrate on within the first 30 days of starting in the position?	labels:Yeah, it's important for us that you get into a position where you can really help us achieve those goals as quick as you can, we really do to get up to speed as quick as possible. As Andy said, we've got those really massive goals that we're aiming for. So we need you to get in a position where you'll be comfortable, and you can help us drive towards those goals.	episode_done:True
