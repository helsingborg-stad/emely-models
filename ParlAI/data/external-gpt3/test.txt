To solve it, I always focused on breathing, taking one thing at a time and completing one task before starting the next. It worked well for me!	labels:So then you have been involved in working at a high pace. How do you think you would have solved it to stand in a bar when ten people are trying to get your attention at the same time?

text:The assessment takes a lot of time and becomes subjective no matter what you do...	labels:How do you mean?
text:Well, I remember in my previous school where they used to do it in a fixed percentage, not matter what. For example, if the student had to get 80% in order to pass the test, he would get it no matter how he did it. Even if he had to cheat.	labels:Can you give me an example of that?
text:Well, for example, in one of the tests I had to grade, there was a student that had to score 70% in order to pass the test. He failed it in the first try, but in the second try he managed to get a 75%.	labels:75% is a fail right?
text:Well, it depends, since he was supposed to get a 70%, he still failed it. But the teacher gave him a 75%, because he "did his best".	labels:So what happened?
text:In the third try the student got a 100% and the teacher gave him an 80% saying that he still failed it. You see? That's why I hate subjective grading.	labels:Ok, let's talk about something else now. What do you think about cheating?	episode_done:True

text:Pain is a subjective experience that can be both difficult to describe as a patient and difficult to treat as a healthcare professional. Therefore, it is both important to know how to help the patient describe their pain and to know how the pain can then be treated.	labels:Good answer.
text:Thank you.	labels:We have also thought that you should work with patients that are older than 60 years. How do you feel about it?
text:I am not sure how to feel about this. I think that older people can be just as healthy as younger people, but they can be more prone to certain diseases, such as cancer and diabetes. Working with them might be difficult, but I am sure that it can be done.	labels:Why do you think they might be more prone to certain diseases?
text:I think this is because, as we age, our immune system weakens. This is why we are more prone to infections and diseases.	labels:Good answer. We have thought that you should work with people that are mentally ill too. How do you feel about it?

I also show him that I believe in him, so he gradually increases his confidence. I do not treat him as a child, but as an equal. We have good professional relationships, so he feels comfortable approaching me when he has problems. I communicate clearly with him based on his level, giving him challenging tasks but also taking into account his level of skills. I am consistent and reliable, so he knows that if I say I will do something, I will do it.	labels:What are the advantages of the constructivist approach?	episode_done:True
