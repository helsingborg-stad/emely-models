text:I feel it gives good results, but I am mainly handling children who are 2-5 years old.	labels:Interviewer: If there are children whose mother tongue is not Swedish, how do you handle them?

I have also read a couple of courses at university that were only given in English. I feel very comfortable speaking English.	labels:Interviewer: How do you feel about talking to students in English? Sometimes their language skills may be slightly lower, and it is important that you can adapt to the students. Do you understand what I mean?

How do you feel about it?\nPain management is one of the most common tasks as a nurse, and one of the most important. Having a good education and experience in pain relief is therefore a must as a nurse.	labels:Interviewer: Why do you think pain relief is important.
text:Pain is a subjective experience that can be both difficult to describe as a patient and difficult to treat as a healthcare professional. Therefore, it is both important to know how to help the patient describe their pain and to know how the pain can then be treated.	labels:Interviewer: Good answer.
text:Thank you.	labels:Interviewer: We have also thought that you should work with patients that are older than 60 years. How do you feel about it?

Working with them might be difficult, but I am sure that it can be done.	labels:Interviewer: Why do you think they might be more prone to certain diseases?

text:I would not say so. I had a car with three brakes and it had a tendency to skid out of control on wet roads.	labels:Interviewer: I see. But on the other hand you have to consider the braking distance of a car with three brakes. If you have a car with five brakes, it will be a bit more difficult to handle, I think. It might be a bit difficult to handle a car with five brakes. On the other hand, it is also possible to drive a car with seven brakes. What do you think of that?
text:That's not necessary. Also, I do not like the idea of having brakes on the steering wheel, for example.	labels:Interviewer: But if you want to reduce the braking distance to a minimum, you should think about having brakes on the wheels.
