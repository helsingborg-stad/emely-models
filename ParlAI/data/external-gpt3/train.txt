It's a lot of work to change over now as well as it would be a lot of money as well. We have been thinking about it for a while, but the time has never been right so far. So, if you were to start from scratch, what would you do?
text:Well, I would probably use one system so that I could run it all from one. I would probably use a system that is not too complicated and that is easy to use. I would probably try to find a system that is affordable and that has a good support system.	labels:What do you think of hogia?	episode_done:True
