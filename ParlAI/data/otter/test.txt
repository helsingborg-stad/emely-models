text:So the question I asked you is if you were given the task of setting the promotion, where would you start and what would you do so I've just outlined a whole bunch of them for you. Are there others?\nWhere and the maybe our department store has a lot of information about our VIP so for example you are so our VIP so I can I can go over your information what what do you like and what is your interest in some kind of	labels:I want to I want to work with you on that I live up okay, I'm the eternal Yeah. What this product is Make money. want lots of customers to buy it? Where do we put it? How do we promote it? And how quickly can you do it? Those are my three questions. Or he texted me all that and I'm giving it right back to you. You're my assistant, you're my marketing specialist. So I need to know what you're going to do not me.

text:On the right path. So it's just, yeah, exactly what you've said here, it's just a, it's just a policy or a procedure for allowing, like the service to describe the, the, the request that's coming in and preventing things like other origins, so maybe like preventing your website from being, like sharing resources between another endpoint, so you're preventing another website from hitting yours as well. So right on there, okay, cool. All right. So switching a little bit a little bit here to more specific JavaScript, you explained that this keyword to me, okay, so\nthis keyword is, is a really complex concept in JavaScript. So, um, as far as, as my understanding this keyword is bind to the context when a function is executed, instead of where it is defined. So. So can I use some specific examples to explain this?	labels:Yeah.
text:so for example, if we if we just execute a function in a global environment, and this will be binded to the, to the global global scope, but if we call us for example, if you have an object a, and we have a method inside called B and A Adobe, then in this kind of circumstances, this would be binding to a Yeah, because we call we call the function inside. Okay. Okay. And so, in JavaScript there, there is also some circumstances when this is not binded to our not that not as we expected, because sometimes, for example, a JavaScript doesn't have a block scope. So sometimes, when we call this we thought it was binding to the function scope, actually, it was fine to Window global scope. Yeah. So and, and some, some, some solutions to this is to use things like the apply or call function or use the bind method to solve this problem.	labels:Cool. All right. Well, speaking of this keyword and scope, can you kind of explain what a closure is in JavaScript?	episode_done:True
text:your base class, let's see you're storing your web elements with the address fine, you're using some page factory pattern over there. And in the same page class, you're using your methods as well, right? Your page methods lets you log in method search method. My question is inside the search method, I search for a product. And inside the method itself, I write an assertion in my page class. And then I'll call that method from the J unit or from testing G. Let's see. Is it a good practice?\nYeah, yeah, what you can do also like putting on that page classes for that, like main functionalities.	labels:So what I'm saying is that writing the assertion inside the page method, or inside the page class, is it a good practice?
text:inside of the method, it's good practice, but I never use putting on the classes page classes, I usually put on the method and then out of that page classes,	labels:okay. Okay. So tell me what are the disadvantages with the page object model design pattern. So these are the advantages you said again, maintenance, reusability, and everything.
