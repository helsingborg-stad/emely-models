text:I am doing fine. Thank you.	 labels:How was the traffic coming over here?
text:I am so glad that the traffic was light this morning. No traffic jam and no accidents.	 labels:That is good. user, lets start the interview. Are you ready?	episode_done:True
text:Do you have any questions for me?\nYes, I would like to know how did this job first become available? And what do you consider the ideal candidate for this particular job,	labels:The job has become available because the person that did it previously has been promoted, which we are very happy with. And the ideal candidate will be someone that can come in that is detail oriented, task oriented, and can get immersed in our culture. Because every work culture is a little different. And learning how we do things, how we expect what we expect, and getting along with people and the customers is a key component of this job. That's what we're looking for. Do you think you would be able to do that?
text:Yes, sir. I think so.	 labels:You have any other question?	episode_done:True
text:Tell me about your career goals. Or if you were to receive this job, what is your plan? What's your long term goal?\nMy long term goals right now is to own my own business. If I was to get this job, I would continue to work this job and continue my education. My plans right now is continuing my education and get a Bachelor's in accounting and in advance about a master's in accounting and I would cause continue to work this job and my ultimate goal is to own my own health, home healthcare service business.	labels:Do you have any questions for me?	episode_done:True
text:The next question, how many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?\nAnd number of tennis balls in a limousine? Well, I guess to effectively answer that question, I would need some help. I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about a stretch SUV, that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine? Are we talking to door for door? I also don't know what's in the limousine already other people in there? Or is it empty? Once I had those questions answered, I would have to do some calculations about the size of a tennis ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up, calculate the inside of the limousine and then make sure the math works out? I could get that answer to you. I just can't do it off the top of my head.	labels:Let me ask this final question. Or do you have any questions for us?	episode_done:True
text:And something I also I want to ask you, you know, we're looking for an executive assistant here, and you won't be the owner. So I just want to be transparent is that there really is no room to go into a separate category if you take on this business. So I guess, you know, is that something that you're okay with?\nYes, no, 100% understand, like I, I really, you know, like to stick to my skills. And I think I'm stronger than them. And I have no interest in really branching out to anything that's not relevant to my skills. So absolutely, I wouldn't, you know, pull out that all of a sudden, I'm interested in marketing, and definitely satisfied by EA work. And what I really enjoy about it actually, is truly the organizational aspect. I've always been someone who is very meticulous, and I love to keep things organized, both for me and for other people, which is why I think I'm good at it, you know, and things can get stressful, especially with executives out there. And I think it's very important to keep those skills home. Awesome.	labels:Okay, cool. So I think that's great. Now I want to backtrack a little bit. It looks like you are with data from 2016 to 2018, which is great. And I know you mentioned the reason for leaving was because of layoffs. What were you doing from December 2018 to may 2019?	episode_done:True
text:So from your resume, I can see you have done very well. And obviously, you've done well. Professionally, you've done well, in your education. What advice would you give to say, new paralegal student or student in general? What are some of the keys to success that you think are necessary?\nproofreading would be the first thing that is so important, because it like inevitably you're going to have corrections. But if you are your pay attention to detail, listen to instructions carefully. Don't get too excited about your assignment that you stop listening, and, and take notes. Because at the time, it may all make sense. But then when you get back to your desk, you're like Oh, my gosh, what did they tell me to do? So you listen, carefully, take good notes, and proofread everything before you give it to the attorney, that will save you some red ink and time later having to go back and make those corrections when you're trying to get something else done.	labels:Excellent. Excellent. I, I couldn't agree more. And even when you're proofreading and you're reading it, sometimes you're looking at and you're like, I know this looks wrong, but I can't figure out why. You know, so. It's amazing. Excellent. Excellent. Well, do you have any questions for me?	episode_done:True
text:What special skills do you have for this job?\nI have good organizational skills. I worked as head office administrator for a while I had to organize the staff in the office laugh.	labels:Do you have any computer skills?	episode_done:True
text:Beyond the day-to-day client servicing, could you tell me about any particular initiatives of which you are particularly proud in your current position?\nMore than anyone else in my office, I have led my clients aggressively into alternative investments. This has not only led to slightly higher returns, but it has also decreased their volatility, and I think more importantly, tightened my relationship with them and built their trust with me. I have shared this success with a couple other managers in my office and they have started to follow this model.	labels:You mentioned earlier that you felt somewhatperhaps the word is stifledby your current boss. I wonder if you could compare or contrast this to your previous bosses. And I wonder if you could describe how you feel your boss could get your best work from you?
text:My previous boss was great. I met with him a lot and learned from him a lot. He gave me specific objectives and goals and would always be there when I needed him for advice, but unlike my current boss I didnt feel that he was constantly checking up on me. He also was very comfortable when I interacted directly with other departments; he wasnt at all territorial that way. But I did keep him informed of substantive issues and any interactions with other departments that might matter. So I would say this previous boss was an excellent model on how to get my best work out of me.	 labels:Can you tell me about your approach to clients? How does it differ from people around you? And has it changed much as you have changed employers?
text:I am working with a high-income, highly educated clientele, and I respect them. Unlike some of my colleagues, I dont feel that my job is to sell them new products. Instead, I feel my value added to them is to educate them about new products and then let them decide whether it works for them. Each client situation I view as being unique. Each one has a different risk/return profile. And each one takes a different amount of time and education to get used to considering a new product. I dont push products. But at the same time, my adaption rate of alternative products has over time become the highest in the office. My clients respect me and I respect them. My high referral rates underscore this.	 labels:user, I know you need to go; you are here on your lunch hour and need to get back to work. But I really like what I have heard. I think that your style could fit in exceptionally well and you could be very happy here. Ill be back to you shortly to set up some times for a follow-up meeting with some of my colleagues as well.	episode_done:True
text:Do you have any special job skills that would help you do your job?\nWell, I have many contacts in the communication sector from my previous job. I also have knowledge of Japanese culture and language. I used to live in Tokyo.	labels:How are you research skills?	episode_done:True
text:Hi, Richard, welcome to the interview.\nThank you.	labels:How would you journey here today?	episode_done:True
text:Well, do you have any questions for me?\nWell, I am interested in what kind of training you would provide, I noticed in the job posting that it did say training is a possibility. So do you have a plan that you in place for training? Or is that something that you would assess as needed?	labels:Yes, so the initial what we call ramping up period, when you join the firm, you would be you'd have a mentor, so a paralegal that has been here much longer and more senior. I mean, the topics are wide, you know, from how to dress in the courtroom to the lowly lead better, you know, Equal Employment Act. And I would say in addition to that, if there was something that came up that you know, another association or another type of webinar or something that you want to attend, then you just have to, you know, talk to the office manager and see if that would work into the budget and in the schedule.
text:That sounds good. I like the idea of a mentor and it sounds like you value ongoing trainings. So that is a good thing. Yes. Can you tell me about the history of the position? Has it been vacant for long is it a new position? Sure.	 labels:So we're actually going to be having two positions. One is a new position, it's a growth position, the caseload where we had the paralegals assigned to different attorneys that the caseload has just been growing at a rate that that that proportionality of ratio showing of paralegal to attorney, we need a new position. So that's a growth position. The other position, the person that occupied the physician previously, went on maternity leave and decided she didn't want to come back. So it is a replacement position. She had been here about six years before she went on maternity leave. So okay.
text:How soon do you think that you'll make a decision in your hiring process?	 labels:Sure. So we are conducting interviews through the end of this week, I would say on Friday, we're going to meet as a committee and just kind of discuss the potential candidates, I would say, I would expect by Friday, for every bit everybody to be notified of what the next step is, it may be you know, we want to have a callback interview. Or it may be that maybe that person isn't the right fit. Or it may be, you know, a job offer if it's just the perfect fit for the position. So but my Friday, you should know something I'd say Friday.	episode_done:True
text:How long have you been working for your former employer?\nI've been working there for three years.	labels:Why do you want to leave that job?
text:I'm looking for a company where I can contribute more and grow. I'm ready to take the next step of my career.	 labels:What exactly made you apply for this job at our company?	episode_done:True
text:That's great. Thank you. So could you tell us a little bit why you want to work here with us?\nI'm also at the stage in my career where I see myself staying with the same organization for a long period of time. And because from what I understand, during my research, you have very ambitious plans for the future. And I would like to be a part of those. Finally, I have and I understand that you hire lots of talented and bright people. So again, that's good for me, because I will get to work alongside some people who will push me and they will challenge me. And that's great for my long term future career plans. So those are the main reasons I see myself being here for a long period of time. And I will be able to grow as your company grows as well.	labels:Thank you, Richard, What experience do you have which is relevant to this role?	episode_done:True
text:Okay, if you stepped in, if I offered you the job, and you stepped into the job, nine o'clock next morning, next Monday morning. I said, sit down. Juliana, what five questions do you have for me about this bank, this bank? What would your questions be for me? I am your manager?\nI might show you what you expect from me, in terms in the training time, why do you expect from me and the last one? You if I will be if you will be able to provide me if I can grow in that company.	labels:Excellent. Good questions. Very good. So now that you have the answers for all that, you got to tell me, what do you do in case of emergency. And we're still mercial, because I can't sit here learning a trade, but I have to go through it. We're going to change roles. Okay, you're going to be B? And I want you to answer this question. Why would I choose you? versus the reason why?	episode_done:True
text:Have you had any English speaking jobs?.\nNo, okay, first job was I was speaking Portuguese and for Canadians. But after that, I found another job. And that job was speaking just English. And in August, I started another school for two months. And after I finished high school, I can't do this study.	labels:Okay, so why do you want to become interested in the banking industry?	episode_done:True
text:Okay, and can you tell me what you feel your greatest strength is?\nmy greatest strength would probably have to be my attention to detail. I'm really like a big perfectionist, every little thing matters.	labels:Okay. And what's your greatest weakness?	episode_done:True
text:Hi, welcome. How's your day going? so far?\nGreat. Great. Can't complain.	labels:So we'll just jump right in. Thanks for bringing a copy of your resume. I actually had a chance to review it. So I want to ask you a couple questions, if you don't mind. So first thing is it looks like you were in a temporary role with YouTube, correct?	episode_done:True
text:Please tell us about yourself. Probably you could tell us about your education first.\nWell, I graduated the Department of oilfield development with high honors and was qualified as Master of Science in petroleum engineering.	labels:Well, your education sounds great. Mr. Darcy. And have you got any experience? Have you worked before?
text:Certainly, I managed to get a job in reservoir engineering and got my first job at research center called the oil. I'm currently a principal technical expert at clusters industries, where I handled our top performing client. Before that, I worked as a principal engineer for a large tech company called oil tech and was involved in the most important projects of oil and gas deposits.	 labels:How long have you been working for clusters industries?	episode_done:True
